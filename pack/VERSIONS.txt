29-06-2014 -- beta 8 - "Rapidity is a justice"
==============================================
General:
- Added ability to have per-game postprocessing shaders
- Added the "forceAlwaysDownsamplingRes" option (can be used to make 
  reluctant games - like Divinity:OS - show downsampling resolutions)
- Added Lanczos downsampling filter option
- Changed default screenshots to also capture GeDoSaTo overlays
- Made screenshot-taking asynchronous (basically 0 performance hit for the first SS)
- Restored neutral render state before downsampling [Boulotaur2024]
- Refactored rendertarget management (to easier turn API agnostic later)
- Hooked a few more Windows API functions, and DXGI/D3D11
GeDoSaToTool:
- Implemented alternative dll injection strategy (for games which build the 
  D3D device before doing anything which would be caught by the default)
- Prevented multiple instances of GeDoSaToTool being started

- Screenshot fallback to full-size if hudless not available
- Fixed Z/stencil buffer format detection (fixes e.g. GTA4)
- Improved handling of automatically generated z/stencil buffers
  (don't duplicate, we don't need an original-res depth buffer when downsampling)
- Potentially fixed compatibility with Windows Vista
Generic Plugin:
- Store screenshots after AA/postprocessing, not before
- Only use float BB if required (should improve AA/post performance on most games)
- Added ability to specify a "marker" pixel shader in the configuration, 
  in order to apply AA/postprocessing before HUD rendering and capture hudless screenshots
GeDoSaToTool:
- Added ability to edit game profiles using the built-in editor 
  (still need to be created externally)
