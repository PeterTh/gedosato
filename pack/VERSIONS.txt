13-07-2014 -- beta 10 - "Poltergeist"
=====================================
General:
- Added keybinding to toggle through scaling methods
- Fixed downsampling with more than 3 level
- Fixed stupid typo preventing games with backbuffer formats other
  than the default from working correctly (thanks Boulotaur2024)
- Now possible to list and query readable app name from whitelist
- Added option to prevent Steam Overlay loading (thanks GoaLitiuM)
- Fixed crash when framedumping, store framedumps as TGA, create folders for each
Generic Plugin:
- Show exe name and (if available) readable name in status display
- Added option to target screenshots/postprocessing to specific renderstate changes
  (injectRenderstate [state],[value]  -- used in Ys Origin profile)
- Added lots of profiles, thanks to all the contributors
GeDoSaToTool:
- Can now sort black/whitelists
- Fixed working directory when launched at startup

13-07-2014 -- beta 9 - "Underground Network"
============================================
General:
- Added nearest neighbour scaling option
- Added "interceptOnlySystemDlls" option to potentially increase compatibility with 3rd party injectors
- Fixed enum ordering in the scaler (should *really* fix Mafia 2)
- Fixed overlays/console not rendering in some games
- Fixed normal resolution screenshot regression introduced in beta 8
- Fixed initialization for games which use automatic depth/stencil generation (e.g. Witcher 1)
- Fixed initial render state settings
Generic Plugin:
- Extended postprocessing/screenshot targeting functionality
  (can now delay to first draw after marked pixel shader is set)
GeDoSaToTool:
- Added option to launch at windows startup
- Added command line option for launching minimized
- Check for and resolve leftover registry entries on startup

29-06-2014 -- beta 8 - "Rapidity is a justice"
==============================================
General:
- Added ability to have per-game postprocessing shaders
- Added the "forceAlwaysDownsamplingRes" option (can be used to make 
  reluctant games - like Divinity:OS - show downsampling resolutions)
- Added Lanczos downsampling filter option
- Changed default screenshots to also capture GeDoSaTo overlays
- Made screenshot-taking asynchronous (basically 0 performance hit for the first SS)
- Restored neutral render state before downsampling [Boulotaur2024]
- Refactored rendertarget management (to easier turn API agnostic later)
- Hooked a few more Windows API functions, and DXGI/D3D11
GeDoSaToTool:
- Implemented alternative dll injection strategy (for games which build the 
  D3D device before doing anything which would be caught by the default)
- Prevented multiple instances of GeDoSaToTool being started
- Added startup checks for path validity and admin rights
- Added basic editors for postprocessing shaders

13-06-2014 -- beta 7 - "Seishoujo Sacrifice"
============================================
General:
- Fixed Alt-tab crash when downsampling in fullscreen mode (!)
- Added IDirect3DSwapChain9 interception 
  (fixes compatibility with some games, e.g. Dragon Age Origins)
- Screenshot fallback to full-size if hudless not available
- Fixed Z/stencil buffer format detection (fixes e.g. GTA4)
- Improved handling of automatically generated z/stencil buffers
  (don't duplicate, we don't need an original-res depth buffer when downsampling)
- Potentially fixed compatibility with Windows Vista
Generic Plugin:
- Store screenshots after AA/postprocessing, not before
- Only use float BB if required (should improve AA/post performance on most games)
- Added ability to specify a "marker" pixel shader in the configuration, 
  in order to apply AA/postprocessing before HUD rendering and capture hudless screenshots
GeDoSaToTool:
- Added ability to edit game profiles using the built-in editor 
  (still need to be created externally)

01-06-2014 -- beta 6 - "Stranger Than Fiction"
==============================================
General:
- Large-scale internal rewrite introducing game-specific plugin system
- Moved all Dark Souls 2 specific code to a Dark Souls 2 plugin

  without a game-specific plugin
- Added performance monitoring system (per-frame CPU and GPU timing)
- Added per-game settings support
- Various bugfixes
Dark Souls 2:
- Added option for different types of SSAO blur 
GeDoSaToTool:
- Now start up activated by default
- Added Text viewer/editor component for readme viewing and editing setting files
